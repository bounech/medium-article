      <h2>Some title one</h2>
      <p>"Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously
      never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy
      circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned
      to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind,
      but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future.
      The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our
      encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon,
      for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination
      for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy.
      But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty."</p>

      <p>"You think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday don't count.
      But yesterday is all that does count. What else is there?
      Your life is made out of the days it’s made out of. Nothin else."</p>

      <h2>Some title three</h2>
      <p>“I’ve become skeptical of the unwritten rule that just because a boy and girl appear
      in the same feature, a romance must ensue. Rather,
      I want to portray a slightly different relationship, one where the two mutually inspire
      each other to live - if I’m able to, then perhaps I’ll be closer to portraying a true expression of love.”</p>
